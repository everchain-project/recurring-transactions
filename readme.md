# Recurring Alarm Clock

The **Recurring Alarm Clock** is a suite of smart contracts for creating recurring alarms on the Ethereum Network. Whenever the alarm clock goes off, it executes a customized task, schedules a new alarm, and then waits for the next alarm to trigger.

Features include:

- Decentralized alarms provided by [Ethereum Alarm Clock](https://www.ethereum-alarm-clock.com/)
- Static time intervals (ie: every 7 days)
- Arbitrary time intervals (ie: on the first of each month) made possible by [bokkypoobah](https://github.com/bokkypoobah/BokkyPooBahsDateTimeLibrary)
